1. Hash table
- a speical data structure that can use key to access values
- use hash function to map key to index/hashcode

2. Tree traversal (Depth first)
- pre-order
- In-order
- post-order

2. Binary Tree
- Each node has at most two children 

3. Binary Search Tree
 - parent's key> all keys in left subtree
 - parent's key< all keys in right subtree
 
4. Heap (complete tree)
 - min heap => root's key < all keys in subtrees
 - max heap => root's key > all keys in subtrees

5. Heap Sort
    - Steps 
    1. Build a max heap
    2. Remove max and reduce the heap size by 1. Heapify the heap. (repeat while heap size>1)
